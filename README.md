<b>Inspiration</b>
We are all students in STEM, and at some point in our lives - or in the future - we would have to apply for jobs. Most job and scholarship applications have the first round of interviews online. Our website was born out of the desire to have a place where developers can practice in real time and get great feedback

<b>What it does</b>
It's a platform to collaboratively solve technical interview problems in real time, take mock technical interviews, and review other peopleâ€™s code. We make use of chat rooms where users can post questions, and join in conversations.

<b>How we built it</b>
We used html and css to create a web-based platform to allow users to practice tech skills

<b>Challenges we ran into</b>
Working with bootstrap was annoying sometimes, and settling on an idea.

<b>Accomplishments that we're proud o</b>
We helped solve a problem for developers searching for jobs by providing a platform where they can practice their interview skills and collaborate with other developers to get helpful feedback

<b>What we learned</b>
We learned Bootstrap, HTML, CSS and JavaScript. We also learned how to divide problems into teams and work together to have a whole product at the end.

<b>What's next for #TicTechTalk</b>
tictechtalk.org We would like to keep on building our website and brand. We would have premium options implemented with shopify, where users can get more questions, have a real mock interview with an agent from the company who can give life feedback. Also, users can buy tickets for tech talks and workshops.

Also, we look forward to implementing this in the corporate world, where people who have the same ideas can find each other and work together, thereby creating more exciting ideas where entrepreneurs rise!
